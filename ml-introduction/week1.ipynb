    "**Supervised learning problems are categorized into \"regression\" and \"classification\" problems.**\n",
    "When we give the algorithm a dataset in which 'right answers' were given.\n",
    "* Also called a **Regression problems** - To predict continous valued outputs.\n",

    "Cocktail Party Problem - \n",
    "Let's say in a party there are two people who speak in the same time and there are two microphones separated by some distance. The CPP algorithm tries to extract the two persons voice. This is a unsupervised learning problem because we are only supplying data with no labels and let the algorithm decide the structure of the data.
